    Ghiro 0.2 has been released!

    Ghiro is an automated image forensics tool: sometimes forensic investigators
    need to process digital images as evidence. Dealing with tons of images is
    pretty easy, Ghiro is designed to scale to support gigs of images.
    All tasks are totally automated, you have just to upload you images and let
    Ghiro does the work. Understandable reports, and great search capabilities
    allows you to find a needle in a haystack. Ghiro is a multi user environment,
    different permissions can be assigned to each user. Cases allow you to group
    image analysis by topic, you can choose which user allow to see your case
    with a permission schema.

    It can be downloaded from http://getghiro.org  in both package and appliance
    ready-for-use.
