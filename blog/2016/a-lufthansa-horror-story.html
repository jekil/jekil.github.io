    <p><strong><span class="caps">TL</span>;<span class="caps">DR</span>:</strong> What happened today? Thanks to the worst customer service
provided by <a class="reference external" href="http://www.lufthansa.com/">Lufthansa</a> I am going to
explain you why I missed a day in Vegas and why, in my over 15 years
experience, you should stop flying&nbsp;Lufthansa.</p>
<p>Today, I was heading to Las Vegas, to chill out at
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.blackhat.com/">BlackHat</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.defcon.org/">Defcon</a>, via Frankfurt and Philadelphia.
I was flying &nbsp;Lufthansa, because in long flights I prefer to spend
more and be safe; with my 2 dogs in a checked-in box. Due to many
Lufthansa fails in logistics and customer service I miss my flight and
I have been <em>re-protected</em> on a flight&nbsp;tomorrow.</p>
<p>So I would dissect the problem, to understand how multiple faults
could face in missing a flight and have a reputational issue to&nbsp;manage.</p>
<p>In my opinion Lufthansa fails could be categorized as&nbsp;follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Manage your logistics</strong>: if you want to check-in more or less 100
people, with only one check-in line open, you are going to, not&nbsp;only
take more time than expected, but taking&nbsp;ages.</li>
<li><strong>Get more personeel</strong>: if the people at check-in desks are the same
opening the gates, they can not start boarding until they finish
checking in people. So one delay one one side leads to another bigger&nbsp;delay.</li>
<li><strong>Training</strong>: please train people, for example at check-in desks they
were totally unaware on the rules to check-in dogs. I had to tell
them how much I was expected to pay and other details, just because I
read the &#8220;How to check-in your dogs&#8221; rules before&nbsp;boarding.</li>
<li><strong>Manage crisis</strong>: when we land in Frankfurt it was clear we were
really late. All times I were late, the company I was flying with,
was so kind to&nbsp;announce &#8220;Hey Mr. X you are late so we are going to
help you, someone is waiting for you at end of the stairs&#8221;. But with
Lufthansa &nbsp;no announcements, nobody cares if a flight is&nbsp;late.</li>
<li><strong>Customer service #1: keep your word</strong>: Landed in Frankfurt, I asked
at the first Lufthansa hostess at the terminal how to get my
connected flight. She checked and said &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry they will wait
for you&#8221;. Sadly but true: I arrived at the gate 10 minutes late and
they don&#8217;t&nbsp;wait.</li>
<li><strong>Customer service #2: manage exceptions</strong>: when I approached the
passport control the line was really long, so I asked a Lufthansa
hostess if there is a priority line for us, she said &#8220;Just one line
and no priority&#8221;. So the incapacity to manage exceptions leads to
re-protection (costs for&nbsp;Lufthansa).</li>
<li><strong>Customer service #3: don&#8217;t be a liar</strong>:&nbsp;I asked again to another
Lufthansa hostess and I insisted, she checked and said &#8220;You will
found someone waiting for you other the passport control&#8221;. No one was&nbsp;waiting.</li>
<li><strong>Customer service #4: make clients happy</strong>: I missed the flight and
asked &nbsp;for support to the service desk, I found an angry&nbsp;girl. When
someone comes to you for a problem caused by you, you should
apologize and reward him. Just saying &#8220;we are sorry, the next flight
is tomorrow&#8221; in economy class because business is fully booked and
you will stay in a shitty hotel with a free 20 euros dinner, when you
are used to five stars hotel and to spend more than that just for
beers looks like a&nbsp;joke.</li>
<li><strong>Cruelty to animals #1</strong>: I asked to have my dogs back for the
night, when I finally had my box back, it was all wet (it was raining
so probably they left it under the rain). The pillow and blanket
inside were wet: my dogs were sitting on the wet. Lufthansa publicize
a lot how they threat pets, I am not sure this it what they&nbsp;meant.</li>
<li><strong>Cruelty to animals #2</strong>: I found a food stamp on the dog&#8217;s box, it
means someone kicked it. I am not sure this is the proper way to deal
with live&nbsp;animals.</li>
<li><strong>Missing authentication</strong>: When I finally found my dog&#8217;s box, it was
left unattended on a corner in a baggage claim hall. No one is
guarding it and no one asked me when I get them. So virtually anyone
could steal your&nbsp;pets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Citing Forrest Gump: &#8220;shit happens&#8221; but how you&nbsp;deal with shit, how you
manage crisis and customer service make the difference from losing
clients and transform an issue in a success story.&nbsp;And please, never be
a&nbsp;liar.</p>
