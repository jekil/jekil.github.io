It is not a flashing news, yesterday **Silk Road 2** has been closed,
admin has been **arrested** and charged, meanwhile in US and EU servers
have been seized by various law enforcement agencies.

The operation dubbed "*Onymous*" was a joint effort of FBI, Eurpol,
Eurojust and US Homeland Security, it was publicly advertised on FBI's
twitter profile.

Many good **articles** are available about operation details and Silk
Road admin profile so I don't want to duplicate them, just have a look
to these nice reads:

-  `Silk Road 2 Seized! (Multiple Markets
   Seized) <http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/11/06/silk-road-2-seized/>`__
-  `Feds Arrest Alleged ‘Silk Road 2′ Admin, Seize
   Servers <http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/11/feds-arrest-alleged-silk-road-2-admin-seize-servers/>`__

The interesting point is the published `sealed
complaint <https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1354808-blake-benthall-complaint.html>`__,
a 33-pages document full of details. It teach us something about OPSEC
and Silk Road operation.

I suggest you to have a look over the document, there are some
interesting highlights:

-  The Silk Road 2 admin, **Blake Benthall aka "Defcon"** is not alone,
   there are others known and unknown people involved. So this one could
   not be the only arrest.
-  He is accused of: narcotics trafficking conspiracy, conspiracy to
   commit and aid and abet computer hacking, conspiracy to transfer
   fraudulent identification documents, money laundering conspiracy.
-  An **undercover** US Homeland Security agent **infiltrated** inside
   the support forum stuff and gained access to private areas. The
   agents are used to get screenshots as proof.

-  FBI estimated Silk Road 2 was generating  sales of at least **8$
   million** and 400.000$ in commissions in October 2014.
-  FBI places the born of Silk Road 2 on 6th **November 2013**.
-  The site was an shopping mall for **drugs** and illegal services,
   just click on an item and put it in the shopping cart, probably the
   most known feature of Silk Road ever. The website had almost the same
   features of Silk Road 1.
-  The admin implemented a Bitcoin **tumbler**, like in Silk Road first
   release.

-  The fee was generally from four to eight percent, after a while a
   fixed fee of five percent was fixed for all services.
-  On December 2013 the admin posted a message saying "DPR places
   **operational security** above all else". Sorry if I tell you, this
   is an OPSEC fail.

-  The admin promptly moved the servers hosting Silk Road 2 when the Tor
   Project announced the  Tor's "de-anonymity" vulnerability. That is
   real vulnerability response.
-  The admin was aware of  "business" risks.

   |Silk road risks|

-  On September 10, 2014 someone around 1,5$ million were **stolen**
   by someone.

-  The website had approximately **150.000** monthly active users.
-  The admin tried to recruit large scale narcotics vendors. He was
   really **marketing** oriented, he focused on how to grow the vender
   user base, improve the offer with new products and how to be
   competitive in the market.
-  Some kind of **intelligence** was available to website stuff:  they
   warned Minnesota's users about an FBI operation defined as "large
   darknet related operation".
-  The admin stated in a forum's message that protecting website
   infrastructure and servers from being seized by law enforcement was
   him top priority. Fail.
-  Law enforcement put offline a server and imaged it, a **forensic**
   analysis was performed. They extracted private keys to run Tor hidden
   server and the website, chat logs and server configuration.
-  Blake used his **personal** email to lease, control and maintain the
   server.

-  Blake accessed email with his original IP address, easily tracked to
   his hotel room.
-  Blake was active on social networking sites (Twitter, Github) and
   leaked some information.
-  Browser **fingerprint** was used as a proof to identify Blake.

Long story short: Silk Road 2 admin did a good job but it was not
enough. He failed in some points about about OPSEC in a job where you
can't fail.

Kudos to FBI and other agencies for the joint operation.
