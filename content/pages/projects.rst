Projects I am developing in my free time are below. As always, if you are interested in getting involved in these projects please give me a shout.

Active projects
---------------

Active and mantained projects.

Awesome Hacking
===============

Awesome hacking is a curated list of hacking tools for hackers, pentesters and security researchers.
Its goal is to collect, classify and make awesome tools easy to find by humans, creating a toolset you can checkout and update with one command.

Cuckoo Sandbox
==============

Cuckoo Sandbox is the leading open source automated malware analysis system. You can throw any suspicious file at it and in a matter of minutes Cuckoo will provide a detailed report outlining the behavior of the file when executed inside a realistic but isolated environment.
In these evolving times, detecting and removing malware artifacts is not enough: it's vitally important to understand how they operate in order to understand the context, the motivations, and the goals of a breach.
Cuckoo Sandbox is free software that automated the task of analyzing any malicious file under Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android.

UDPot
=====

The idea behind this script is to provide a DNS honeypot which logs all requests to a SQLite database and with a configurable interactivity level.
It can be configured to resolve only a number of DNS requests to seems like an open resolver to an attacker, after that it acts as a sinkhole.
For each request coming from a source IP only a custom number of requests are really resolved (sending back a DNS reply) before working as a sinkhole; after a configurable timeout, it can restart the loop.

Malwr was a service that offered free malware analysis with a publicly-accessible Cuckoo Sandbox.

Screwed File Monitor
====================

Never happened to lose files due to file system failure or corruption? And when you need them, you found they corrupted by so much time all your backups don't have a good copy.
Screwed file monitor is a simple tool to detect file alterations or corruption and warn you, so you can get a fresh copy out of your backups.
