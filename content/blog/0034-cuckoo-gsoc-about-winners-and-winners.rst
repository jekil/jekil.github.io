I hope you already know, this year `Cuckoo
Sandbox <http://cuckoosandbox.org/>`__ joined the `Google Summer of
Code <https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015>`__
program thanks to the `Honeynet Project <https://honeynet.org/>`__.

We proposed two project ideas: a `Linux analyzer
project <https://honeynet.org/gsoc/ideas#project18>`__ and a `Mac OS X
analyzer project <https://honeynet.org/gsoc/ideas#project19>`__.

We got a lot of submissions, many talented and skilled students applied
with their project proposal. Sadly Google gave only 8 slots for all the
Honeynet organization, so trying to decide which lucky students
would eventually be accepted was an hard task.

Difficult decisions unfortunately had to be made to best use the limited
number of slots, so only the best student of all Cuckoo project ideas
was selected.

The winner was `Dmitry Rodionov <https://twitter.com/rodionovme>`__
with the Mac OS X analyzer project. He will work with me and
`Jurriaan <https://twitter.com/skier_t>`__ during this summer to extend
Cuckoo analysis capabilities to Mac OS X. If you are interested in, you
can follow the progress in a `public
GitHub <https://github.com/rodionovd/cuckoo-osx-analyzer>`__ repository.

At some point several students who applied to the Linux project started
to discuss about the project regarding from the GSOC results, asking for
our help on some design ideas. That was amazing to me, they are pushed
by curiosity. They are winners too.
