Well, my name is **Alessandro Tanasi**, but I am mostly known as **jekil**.

People say I am an **hacker** and a **security researcher**, although I do not trust them. I have always been interested in how things work, and how they could possibly be breaked.

Someone described me as *"a grumpy old master craftsman, who sleeps with a paper roll printout of some issue trackers and determined to keep the world's code decent and firmly believes that his death will be caused by an overdose of exception handling"*.

Usually I write few `thoughts <https://jekil.sexy>`__ about computer security and whatever,
other times I `code <https://github.com/jekil>`__ for beers, sometimes I
`tweet <https://twitter.com/jekil>`__.

You can connect with me writing to `alessandro@tanasi.it <mailto:alessandro@tanasi.it>`__,
an `encrypted <https://emailselfdefense.fsf.org/en/>`__ email is really appreciated, my `GPG key <{filename}/public/jekil-keys/D8A1E49A.asc>`__
fingerprint is:
