`Ghiro <http://getghiro.org>`__ is an open source project and it is
driven by community needs: users feedback has a great value for us.

We always want to provide a **comfortable** tool for user support: we
have IRC chat for real time support and a `mailing
list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ghiro>`__ for asynchronous
question and answer.

Today we are announcing a **new** support tool: the `Ghiro and Image
Forensics Forum <https://forum.getghiro.org>`__.

We hope this will be an easy to use way share information, requests and
feedback not only about Ghiro but also about any **Image Forensics**
topic.

The forum has several categories, local forums where you can talk in
your native language (if a forum for your country is missing, just ask
and it will be added), registration with third party account (i.e.
google, github), and many other features.
