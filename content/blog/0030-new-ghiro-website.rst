It seems that the old `Ghiro website <http://www.getghiro.org/>`__ was
too hard for understand for people visiting it.

All we know people stops on websites few seconds, so **contents** should
be delivered in an efficient way, with a **simple** layout and  short
web page.

After one year we read about people that barely were able to understand
what Ghiro is, if it is an automated digital forensic tool or a brand
new Photoshop clone. We read about people asking where they can download
it, how much it costs a license and so on.

So our `burlone <https://twitter.com/burloneM>`__, Ghiro's design
engineer, put together a brand new website, check it out it
at  http://www.getghiro.org and let us know if you like it.
