Ghiro development branch moved!

We moved development branch (where next Ghiro's release is currently
developed) to `master
branch <https://github.com/Ghirensics/ghiro/tree/master>`__. Starting
from now, if you want to follow Ghiro's development you have only to
follow our GitHub
`master <https://github.com/Ghirensics/ghiro/tree/master>`__ branch.
Easy peasy.

Check it out! We are always developing amazing, at least we hope so, new
features. Please remember you can use
`GitHub <https://github.com/Ghirensics/ghiro/issues>`__ to opening
tickets for us: if you spot a bug or want a new feature.
