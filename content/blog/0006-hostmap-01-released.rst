I am happy to announce hostmap:

    **hostmap** is a free, automatic, hostnames and virtual hosts
    discovery tool written in Python by `Alessandro \`jekil\`
    Tanasi <http://www.tanasi.it/>`__ and licensed under `GNU General
    Public License version
    3 <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html>`__ (GPLv3). It's goal
    is to enumerate all hostnames and configured virtual hosts on an IP
    address. The primary users of hostmap are professionals performing
    vulnerability assessments and penetration tests.
