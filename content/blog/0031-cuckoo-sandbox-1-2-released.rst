After a while we finally released `Cuckoo
Sandbox <http://cuckoosandbox.org/>`__ 1.2!

It is one of the Cuckoo's release with the most impressive amount of new
features, just to mention a few:

-  XenServer machinery support
-  Physical machine support, to run analysis on bare metal
-  Comparative reporting, you can compare analysis in a fancy way
-  Improved visualization of network data

A complete list of feature is available in the `announce
post <http://cuckoosandbox.org/2015-03-04-cuckoo-sandbox-12.html>`__, I
kindly suggest to have a look over it.
