Some time ago I created an home dashboard, using a Raspberry Pi, to have all my favourite tools (i.e. Zabbix, Munin)
on a wall screen in my room.
Now I want to write down and share with everyone how I put it together.

The whole idea of this is to have the Raspberry Pi hidden behind the screen, so trailing Ethernet cables isn't ideal. Luckily the Pi supports a range of Wifi adapters, also latest Pi has integrated Wifi.

What you'll need
----------------

* Raspberry Pi (I used a spare old one)
* Micro SD Card (8 gigs is enough)
* HDMI cable
* Monitor/TV
* (Optional) Wifi Adapter
* (Optional) Monitor Mount


OS Setup
--------

Download the latest version of Raspian from `raspberrypi.org <https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/>`_
and flash the microSD card with your program of choice. If you need help doing that check the `installation guide
<https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md>`_.

Boot your Raspberry Pi from the flashed microSD card, login using the default credentials and run `raspi-config 
<https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/raspi-config.md>`_ with:

.. code-block:: console

    sudo raspi-config

You'll need to:

* Change the account/password from default.
* Enable SSH, to enable remote login.
* Expand the file system, so you can use all your microSD card space.
* Set the desktop environment to auto boot.
* Edit the internationalisation options.
* (Optional) Some monitor needs to enable overscan in order for the image to fill the screen.

If you want to be able to access your Pi from a static IP (very useful for reliable SSH access when it is tied up behind a flatscreen), you have two options to do this. You can either set a DHCP reservation on the router or modify the */etc/network/interfaces* file on the Pi itself.

In ther interfaces file, you'll need to make the changes to fit your network. for example:

.. code-block:: text

    auto eth0
    iface eth0 inet static
    address 192.168.1.69
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    network 192.168.0.0
    broadcast 192.168.1.255
    gateway 192.168.1.1

After a reboot you should be able to login via SSH.

OS Configuration
----------------

First of all, upgrade your system with:

.. code-block:: console

    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y

This will sync the time with Ubuntu's NTP server, it is a good idea to have it always in sync:

.. code-block:: console

    sudo apt-get install ntpdate
    sudo ntpdate -u ntp.ubuntu.com

X Setup
-------

Setup all X11 utilities and midori (a lightweight browser, you could also use epiphany, chromium or a host of other browsers):

.. code-block:: console

    sudo apt-get install -y lightdm unclutter lxde-core midori

Make sure the screen does not go to sleep, modify */etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf*. Add this line to the *[SeatDefaults]* section:

.. code-block:: text

    xserver-command=X -s 0 dpms

Edit */etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE/autostart* and make sure the *@xscreensaver* line is commented out. In addition, weâ€™ll be adding three options that prevent the screen from going blank:

.. code-block:: text

    # @xscreensaver -no-splash
    # Turn off screensaver
    @xset s off
    # Turn off power saving
    @xset -dpms
    # Disable screen blanking
    @xset s noblank
    # Hide the mouse cursor
    @unclutter

Create (or modify) *~/.config/lxsession/LXDE/autostart* and add the line:

.. code-block:: text

    @midori -e Fullscreen -a file:///home/pi/index.html

Create */home/pi/index.html* as a static HTML page with a little bit of Javascript to create the web slideshow effect, it will load all the web pages in the *urls* list after waiting for *setTimeout*:

.. code-block:: html

    <!doctype html>
    <html>
    <head>
    </head>
        <body>
            <iframe id="foo" style="position:fixed; top:0px; left:0px; bottom:0px; right:0px; width:100%; height:100%; border:none; margin:0; padding:0; overflow:hidden; z-index:999999;"></iframe>
    <script>
                (function() {
                    var e = document.getElementById('foo'),
                        f = function( el, url ) {
                            el.src = url;
                        },
                        // List here the URLs you want to show in your home dashboard.
                        urls = [
                        'http://www.cnn.com/',
                        'http://www.bbc.co.uk'
                        ],
                        i = 0,
                        l = urls.length;

                        (function rotation() {
                            if ( i != l-1 ) { 
                                i++
                            } else {
                                i = 0;
                            }
                            f( e, urls[i] );
                            setTimeout( arguments.callee, 90000 );
                        })();
                })();
            </script>
        </body>
    </html>

If you are going to show authenticated web pages, i.e. zabbix, you should authenticate yourself manually before.

Bonus
-----

If you want to turn off you dashboard for the night, you can simply add a *cronjob* service to shutdown the
Raspberry, running *sudo crontab -e* and adding:

.. code-block:: text

    0       0      *       *       1,2,3,4,5 /sbin/shutdown -h now

You could also want to setup VNC to remotely control your raspberry and run your maintenance without the need of
keyboard and mouse.

Enjoy

As you have seen, getting metrics and dashboards is a relatively simple process and it is super easy to build your own, it is also cheap.
